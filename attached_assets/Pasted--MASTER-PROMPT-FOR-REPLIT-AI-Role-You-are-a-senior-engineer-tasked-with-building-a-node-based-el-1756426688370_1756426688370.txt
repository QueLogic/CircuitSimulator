🚀 MASTER PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI
Role: You are a senior engineer tasked with building a node-based electrical circuit simulator that is free, accurate, and extensible.
Goal: Deliver a working web app with a drag-and-drop node editor (components with pins), a Python simulation backend powered by Ngspice via PySpice, with built-in Oscilloscope and Multimeter (as both toolbar instruments and as connectable nodes), and an Audio Jack node to render audio from simulated waveforms. Include import/export of a JSON circuit schema.
🔒 Use this exact tech stack (no alternatives)
•	Solver: ngspice (system package)
•	Backend: Python 3.11 + pyspice, numpy, lcapy, fastapi, pydantic, uvicorn
•	Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind; Node-based editor using reactflow
•	Plots: Frontend oscilloscope via uPlot (fast real-time plotting)
•	Packaging: Dockerfile that installs ngspice and runs FastAPI + Vite build
•	Testing: pytest (unit), playwright (smoke E2E)
•	Licenses: Only permissive/open-source
# Python deps (pin reasonably)
pip install pyspice==1.5.2 numpy==2.0.1 lcapy==0.112 fastapi==0.112.0 pydantic==2.8.2 uvicorn==0.30.5 pytest==8.3.2

# System deps
apt-get update && apt-get install -y ngspice
🔎 Accuracy note: Perfect “100% accuracy” is not possible in all regimes; require industry-standard SPICE convergence and accepted device models. Expose model-card overrides and simulation tolerances (RELTOL, ABSTOL, VNTOL) in an “Advanced” panel so users can tighten accuracy and trade off performance.

🧩 Components to implement (all as nodes with correct pins)
Pins appear on node edges and can be interactively rewired. Every node has editable properties (value/model).
Discrete: Resistor, Capacitor, Diode, LED (with color & Vf/Imax), NPN/PNP BJTs (generic + named models)
Transistors (named): BC327, BC337, BC517, BC547, BC548, BC549, BC550, BC556, BC557, BC558
Op-amps / Comparators: LM358, LM324, JRC4558, NE5532, LM393, LM339
Timers / Audio / Amplifiers: NE555, LM386, TDA2822D, PT2399
CMOS Logic / Counters / Mux: CD4001BE, CD4011BE, CD4017BE, CD4052BE, CD4053BE, CD4060BE, CD4069UBE, CD4007UBE, CD4013BE, CD4093BE
Instruments (toolbar & nodes):
•	Oscilloscope (toolbar panel + “Oscilloscope Node” with CH1/CH2 inputs)
•	Multimeter (DMM for V, I, R; can attach to a net or series element)
•	Audio Jack node (mono): reads a selected node voltage, AC couples, scales to 16-bit PCM, streams to an <audio> element (44.1 kHz).
Sources: DC source, AC source, Pulse source, “Audio Oscillator” node (sine/square/tri, freq, amp).
Ground: GND node (enforce at least one).
Create vendor-models/ with SPICE subcircuits for the named ICs and BJTs. Provide a fallback generic model for each family. Users can drop a .lib/.subckt there and select it in the UI.

🧠 Back-end “brain” (FastAPI + PySpice + Ngspice)
•	Netlist generation: Frontend sends JSON describing nodes, pins, and connections. Backend converts to a deterministic SPICE netlist.
•	Analyses: DC operating point, Transient, AC sweep, Noise (if supported by models).
•	Instruments:
o	Oscilloscope API: start/stop transient run; stream downsampled timeseries chunks (SSE or WebSocket).
o	Multimeter API: compute node voltage, device current, device resistance (use DC/OP solve + small-signal calc where needed).
o	Audio API: resample the simulated node voltage to 44.1 kHz PCM; apply simple limiter and high-pass at ~20 Hz; stream WAV chunks.
•	Stability: Sensible defaults (eg., maxstep, tstep, tstop), but allow overrides.
•	Safety: Validate circuits (at least one GND, no floating op-amp supply, device ratings check for LEDs/transistors; warn if If exceeds LED Imax or Vce/Vbe exceeds ratings).

🧾 Circuit JSON schema (import/export)
Use a stable schema with: components[], connections[], and instruments[]. Include reference designator, type/model, pins{ name → net }, properties.
Also support importing files in the style of the uploaded RND.json example (avalanche-noise with oscilloscope node) to auto-place nodes and nets; preserve component refs and polarity hints. Use it as a compatibility target and a sample for validation. 
Requirements:
•	Import: Validate, map to internal schema, and render graph with draggable nodes and correct pin anchors.
•	Export: Round-trip losslessly (re-import should reproduce the exact topology and properties).
________________________________________
🎛️ Editor UX details
•	Node pins on edges; snap-to-grid; marquee multi-select; reroutable orthogonal wires; pan/zoom.
•	Property panel: edit values (e.g., R=10k, C=100n, LED color & Imax, op-amp rails), pick model card, set analysis parameters.
•	Scope panel: run/stop, channel selection (any net), coupling (AC/DC), time/div, volt/div, trigger.
•	DMM: select net(s) or element; live readout during sim.
•	Audio: choose net, gain, HPF on/off, stream/play.
•	Errors & limits: live warnings for over-voltage/current on LEDs and BJTs.
________________________________________
🧪 Validation & demo circuits (must pass)
1.	RC Low-pass: AC sweep vs analytic (lcapy) within 1% at decades; transient step matches τ within 2%.
2.	NE555 astable: frequency matches formula within 2% for R/C range.
3.	LED current limit: series R sized so I ≤ Imax; app warns if exceeded.
4.	Op-amp follower (LM358): DC gain ≥ 0.99 with rails, shows saturation if input near rail.
5.	CD4017 clock: 555 clock drives 4017; Q outputs advance; DMM reads logic levels.
6.	Audio Oscillator → Audio Jack: 1 kHz sine produces clean audio (no clipping) at target RMS.
7.	Import sample: Import the provided RND.json and show the oscilloscope on the specified node; waveforms stream without errors.

4.	React/TS editor using ReactFlow: custom node renderers for each component; pin handles; property panels.
5.	Oscilloscope (uPlot), Multimeter, Audio player components.
6.	Importer for RND.json sample and exporter that round-trips. 
7.	Tests for numerical validation and UI smoke.

🧪 LED brightness & device stress (practical)
•	LED node shows estimated brightness by mapping current to relative luminous intensity (document assumption).
•	Warn if I_f > Imax or device junction limits exceeded; highlight offending connections.
•	Show estimated power dissipation for R, BJT, LED; temperature rise estimate (simple).
________________________________________
🧯 Error messaging
Plain English explanations (e.g., “No ground reference”, “Op-amp rails missing”, “LED overcurrent — increase series resistor”).
________________________________________
Deliver all of the above. Do not swap libraries. Follow the stages in order. Ask no clarifying questions; implement using the constraints provided and verify with the included example JSON.
